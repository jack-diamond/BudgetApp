# BudgetApp
Budget app that divides income between three ratios. User can then pull out money from these three different categories.
This app is based off of the 50/30/20 budgeting strategy that simply divides your money into three categories: Need, Want, Save.
The user can input income which is divided between these percentages. The user then subtracts the amount that they spend from
the appropriate category.
